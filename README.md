## Revised Search experience for Bethesda Fallout 4 Mods Page:

### Why I Chose This Site:
As a lover of video games and creating custom content, I regularly use mods in my gaming experience. One search experience that I have continually found frustrating is Bethesda's Mods catalog. Bethesda games are very well thought out, which is why I found the search to be such a juxtaposition. I am proposing the following changes to better the search experience and to help increase visibility for featured and promoted content (Bethesda may be creating mods in the future to sell to players). I am also 'gamifying' the experience a bit, to add more carryover between the two experiences. I am doing this through the use of buttons, lists, scrolling, and dynamic results that display in real-time.

### Current Bethesda page:
https://bethesda.net/en/mods/fallout4

### Proposed Changes:
- add visual search bar vs. search button that exists to draw the eye and cause less confusion
- have results dynamically change as content is filtered or search keywords are being typed in search bar
- promote content through banners at top of page and featured section (featured items stay static regardless of search criteria)
- sorts results into Most Popular and Highest Rated (based on platform and/or timeframe) 
  - Most Popular and Highest Rated start high and include all results. There is no cut off for lowest rating or least popular.
