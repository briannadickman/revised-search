## Revised Search experience for Bethesda Fallout 4 Mods Page:

### Current Bethesda page:

### Proposed Changes:
- add visual search bar vs. search button that exists to draw the eye and cause less confusion
- have results dynamically change as content is filtered or search keywords are being typed in search bar
- promote content through banners at top of page and featured section (featured items stay static regardless of search criteria)
- sorts results into Most Popular and Highest Rated (based on platform and/or timeframe) 
  - Most Popular and Highest Rated start high and include all results. There is no cut off for lowest rating or least popular.
